In this project we are going to designand build a website and DBMS for Project Topi.



Please Use the virtualenv in the zip so that you don't need to install all the libraries locally.


Use ./django/bin/activate <<-- In Windows( You might run into an error like 'You cannot run scripts
                                           on this system' It can be fixed bypassing execution policy e.g.
                                           run -> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -scope CurrentUser 
                                           And it now the cript can run.)
Use source /django/bin/activate <<-- In Linux


This is not the final version of this project by any means and it will be worked on in Summer 2022
and hopefully be completed and up and running in Spring 2022 IN SHA ALLAH!!
